# Hey 👋🏻 Glad you're here! 👨🏻‍🚀
I started using GitHub just to try it out, and it became a place to store ideas I've been exploring. I come from a science background and first got into programming thanks to bioinformatics. Programming began as a way to automate and speed up repetitive work. Then it quickly turned into a way to experiment, learn, and build things that make life easier for others. Right now, I’m focused on bringing ideas to life with GenAI, combining project management skills and code to turn messy real-world problems into simple, reliable solutions that help empower people.
